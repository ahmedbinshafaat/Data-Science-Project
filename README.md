# Data-Science-Project
In this project we use data from real Premier league football games collected during the Premier league seasons 2016, 2017 and 2018.  We focus on analyzing the factors that influence the interestingness and number of goals during the game. Firstly the data has been explored followed by which the match results are pre-dicted and then it is classified whether a match is interesting or not.   Correlationmatrix, pair plots and PCA are the methods that are being used for data ex-ploration.   Moving on, for predicting the total number of goals of the matches,Linear and polynomial regression of degree 2 and 3 are used.   And for classifying whether a match is interesting or not KNN classification and Logistic regression are  utilized.    The  results  achieved  from  the  different  models  of  regression  are almost the same but in the case of classification an accuracy of 63%  has been achieved from logistic regression model that was applied.
